# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Welcome to Server Commander (Client) repo!
This is a project built by alicethefemme, designed for homelabbers and small businesses to monitor servers on the go! This project utilizes React Native and Expo to create the mobile application used to manage servers, and provide the security to do so with peace of mind.

## How to run this
The development build can be ran in a multitude of ways:
1. Expo Snack to view the code online on a mobile (Doesn't offer connectivity)
This option is available for those who don't have a mobile device or an android emulator to be able to test this application. It allows for you to visualise the code online, and get a preview of the display and the code, whilst also providing you the ability to modify certain elements in real time.
**The *web* version of this code doesn't work! This application is designed purely for mobile (Android and iOS)**.
